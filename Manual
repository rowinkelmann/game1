Game Manual  

The game I am planning to build will be a slightly modified version of snake.

The “live” blocks will be the snake itself.

The “dead” blocks will be the snake food.  This is where my game will be modified,
as I will have the food start the color green and then after 5 seconds change to 
yellow and after another five seconds turn black.  If you eat the food when it is 
green you will gain 2 points and gain one point for eating it when it is yellow.  
The black food however is “rotten” and if you eat it you will lose.  A new piece 
of food will appear at a random location in the field of play after either the previous 
food is eaten or 10 seconds goes by, whichever comes first.  The “rotten food will be 
removed from the field of play after it has been “rotten” for 15 seconds.

A player can also lose by crashing into one of the “walls” marking the end of the field of play.

The player will control the snake with the arrow keys.
